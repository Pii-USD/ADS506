-- Project Status: Active

# Instaforllation
R will be used for the completion of the project and it's suggested to collaborate with GitHub. or Git. 

# Introduction
The main purpose of this project is to learn on how to forecast and/ or predict MSFT stock market with time series analysis in R. MSFT dataset is from Mar 1986 to Dec 2022. We expect to create a proper model to predict MSFT market in 2024.

# Project Description
Dataset is currently obtained from Kaggle but we will utilize quantmod package from R to get the latest ticker information. There are 7 variables which are consist of Date, Low, Open, Volume, High,	Close	and Adjusted Close.
